Challenge: Titan City 3023 

TITAN TRAILS

Youâ€™re an astronaut on a sample return mission to Titan.
The presence of vast amounts of complex organic molecules and the potential for liquid water make Titan a promising place in the search for life.
Your task is to collect as many samples of organic matter as possible during your brief mission - to survive you must avoid the freezing methane rain - as well as other threats.
